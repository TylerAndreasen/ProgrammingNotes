JavaFX Project <-- Not the library one
Ensure VM Args are set, should be in one of the previous JFX projects

Stage - Meta Object - The window
Scene - Add/Remove drawing surfaces to the stage
Scene-Graph - Heirarchical Tree containing nodes
Node - The things (buttons, text-boxes et cetera)
	Root
	Branch
	Leaf


launch(args);

start()
	Gives us a Stage object, need a root node and a scene.
	Add the root to the scene and the scene to the stage

mainStage.show(); //at the end of the start()
