# Ant: A Java build tool

Like Gradle and Maven, Ant is a Java build tool, meaning it provides developers with functionality that automates complex tasks that would otherwise be manually completed, leaving room for errors and oversights. Ant as I understand it pre-dates Maven and Gradle, though I have not explored it in detail at this time.
It is also at this time that I realize something rather important. I should be doing all of my developement work (especially for this class) in a virtual environment, and I have not been. I believe that all of my current progress on the product is reflected on the remote, and as such I should be able to pull down the repo to the virtual environment with relative ease.
