# Media Server

My brother has setup a Plex Media Server for the house (which in future I can access remotely through some system, though I am not highly concerned).
Given high winds in the area, my brother has asked me to turn the server off as he is away, and I realize that I need to take notes on this.

Luckily this should be pretty simple, accessing the link [192.168.0.250](http://192.168.0.250) should take any device on the same network directly to the server.

After some issues with my own credentials, I was sent the root credentials and pressed the Shutdown button on the webUI. So this process should be easier in future.
