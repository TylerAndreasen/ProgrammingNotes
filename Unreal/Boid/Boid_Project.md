# The Boid Project

I intend to learn Subversion, Unreal, and somethings about ML. A relatively simple project for this is to make a simple example project in Unreal that model a boid (deliberate misspelling of bird based on the near enough behavior) that tracks a target.

The first iteration will seek to allow the boid to track a target in a bounded space. Then introduce obstacles. Then set the target to move/be movable by a user at runtime.

First many installs and much tutorial watching will be required. As well as deciding on langages and ML technique.



Okay, after quite a lot of fighting, I am reminded that trying to dive into multiple tools at once is far more than I can handle especially without taking notes. I see that if I have notes on Godot (I switched after getting very overwhelmed by not being able to do what I thought would be basic tasks in Unreal), I have not moved them into my collection of all notes. I forget just how much context and knowledge is required to make game engines happen. Perhaps it is better to use something even simpler like raylib to try this out the first time, as the tools are far simpler, I have notes on C++ and raylib available, and building the logic for movement and artifical intelligence should be relatively easier than trying to attach scripts to objects and actors.
