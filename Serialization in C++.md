# Serialization in C++

To learn how to serialize objects in C++, I intend to write a simple program that I can then reference when I implement serialization into QG.

It seems that, according to [this]https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/serialize-and-deserialize-an-object-in-cpp/) GeeksForGeeks article, object serialization is slightly more manual in C++ than Java, but ultimately not wildly difficult. You need to include <fstream>, for reading and writing to files. And you need to define both a serialize method, and a deserialize method in the class you are aiming to serialize. For simplicity, I have copied the linked example code and will step through the code to see how it works.

After walking through the example code provided, it turns out that there is even less effort needed as a developer to implement serialization than I thought. Much of the code from G3G is (I assume) good practice file IO, and there is a single method that writes the object to a file. Now, the way this example is laid out, there is no way to write multiple objects to the same file, which would largely defeat the purpose of storing data in a file, though I expect that the tutorial also shows an example of this.

The G3G example infact did not show an example of this. I know that Raylib does include a number of things for File system operations, but I have yet to look closely at them, and how easily I can adapt them for my purposes. My aim is to be able to read and write the entire graph with a single method called from within main(). Given that I only ever plan on running this on my own hardware, and have no intention of cross-platform uses, I will probably leave this as fairly restricitve to Windows for file searching. That said, later implementations will want the ability to read and write multiple graphs, for now I will want to start with a single graph in a single place, meaning I will want a single "FILE_NAME" constant that the program uses.
