Plan for the Flappy Project:
	Recreate the mobile time waster Flappy Bird inside Godot to learn the tool and expand my comfort with the interface.
	The major components of the game are the Bird, the Pipes, User Input, and the Score.
	Depending on the programming Language I choose, this will take more or less work.

Bird Design
	Sprite2D - Circle, maybe with a line to indicate the direction adjusted when falling.
	RididBody2D - handles the application of gravity and 
	Code - applies a force to the bird that simulates a jump, called when the user presses a key (possibly anything other than Esc).

Pipes Design
	Sprite - Green Block
	RigidBody - to be moved across the screen overtime
	CharacterBody2D - an object which detects collisions but relies on code for movement and collision response. Movement will simply be to slide left, and any collision will result in a game restart.

Multi-Pipe
	I will need to repeatedly instantiate the full detecting-double-pipe object. This is to avoid a memory leak, and to setup new positions for future pipes.
	Idea: In a later version, use Perlin Noise to create smooth transitions between pipe locations.

**At this time, I do not know the name of the component that I am looking for to accomplish this, but it should be straightforward to find on godot's tutorial/whatever page

**Later
ScoreManager
	
HUD
	Visualizaes the score to the player.
