# An Introdcution to Godot

While I do not have a ton of experience with Godot, I have done some work and have some notes, which is largely the context in which I wrote notes on C# (the other large portion being for Unity).

Below are some helpful links, mostly from Arkade Games on YouTube, that should give some insight. I intend to add more to this document in the future.
