Most things in a Godot Project is a Scene, roughly equivalent to what Unity would call a Scene or a Prefab.

Scenes are then arranged in a Tree, representing at minimum a collection of a few Nodes (the most basic objects).

Signals are notifications sent between scenes/nodes based on the Model-View-Controller concept of an Observer.
