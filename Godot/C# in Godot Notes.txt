After running into weirdness with GDScript and not wanting to deal with odd
syntax to ensure type safety, I am switching to C#. In doing so, I found a
rather helpful tutorial that gave a fantastic explanation of how to use C# in
Godot.
I am still unsure how to smoothly open a Godot project folder in VSCode, but I can take a couple steps for now.

I now have a yellow circle (inscribed in a white box, still no idea) that falls
and will move up in response to the player pressing space. WOOT!

Now, I need to return to the plan that I made a while back and act on those
original designs. I put thought into them, and they are basically just plans being handed to me bc they were so long ago.
