I am at a loss.

I am unable to find any helpful information about how to properly use the Tree node in Godot in C# online. The code from the documentation does not seem to do anything, or I am just not using the right magic words to make any thing appear.

At this point I am concidering (well in the future) making my own Tree Framework that I understand. I know I saw another user build one themselves and I am sure I could too.

But ultimately, I can find, or be pointed to resources for, todo lists and planners for mobile and desktop environments, which is what I really want. But am hesitant to look for any as I expect any that I would find would sell my personal information for profit.
