# Pong in RayLib

[Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLJlTaFvHo4)

With some guideance, I created a version of Pong using Raylib, a C++ library that makes 2D graphics very easy. I know there are a huge amount of other things that Raylib can do, I am yet to dive into them yet.

### **What did I learn?**

1. I learned a whole lot about C++ and the ways it is different from Java, though I am unclear on many of the details.
2. I learned that Raylib has a whole host of useful functions like TextFormat() which takes a formatting string and any arguments which should be applied to the string. (Similar functionality exists in Java with String.format() and printf()).
3. I learned that the tutorial I followed saw a lto of benefit from a viewing and developing perspective by placing all code into a single file, as this allowed referencing global variables for things like the player and cpu scores very easily.

### **What is next?**

I want to build snake next. While there is a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGqsnM_WEK4) from the same guy, I want to think through the design challenges myself.
