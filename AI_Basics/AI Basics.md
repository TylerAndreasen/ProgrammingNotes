# AI Basics

This is an overview document for the AI Basics section of my programming notes.
At this time, I am interested in learning more about machine learning on a practical level. I think it would behove me to express what it is I want to learn and how I would like to apply this in the future.
Briefly, I am not personally highly interested in LLM tools, they can be helpful in (what are for me) narrow situations (as I currently avoid simply using them to pump out simple code), mostly finding terminology that search engines are not great at.
I am interested in mimicing projects like Code Bullet for my own learning, but I eventually want to write suffecient scripts in Papyrus to let Skyrim learn to play itself.

After a brief attempt with Python, I recalled how strange the language feels, and the first graphics context I used today lacked apparent frame rate control, so I plan to now try to build a basic flappy bird in raylib.
