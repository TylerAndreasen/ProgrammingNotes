# NeoForge Example Mod Exploration

I found an  NeoForge mod template online somewhere but can no longer find the source. My version can be found locally at `C:\Users\CanaDev\MinecraftModdingFiles\CanaTweaks0`. I have an almost unaltered copy from the original source (only possibly edited to ensure that all dependencies can be properly accessed). The cited version will contain the following: the original source, comments and extra documentation based on what I learn through experimentation, minor changes to the original source to experiment with what code does and what effects different changes have.

# TODOs

Documentation Read List
- net.neoforged.fml.event.config.ModConfigEvent;
- net.neoforged.neoforge.common.ModConfigSpec;

Write an order of operations for the Mod start up process based on the example constructor. Explore what breaks when certain things are commented out.
# Questions

As I am reading code and doing other experimentation, I will have a variety of questions come up that I want answers to to help me understand the tools being presented.

1. What is a ModConfigSpec specifically and what does it allow me to do?
2. What is the effect of the several ModConfigSpec creation lines in Config.java?
3. What specifically is common setup?
4.
