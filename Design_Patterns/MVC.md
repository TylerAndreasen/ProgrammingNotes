# MVC

The Model View Controller or MVC design pattern describes a systematic way to construct responsive user interfaces, implementing three major components.

The Model takes on the basic responsibilities of an OOP object. It stores the data need to represent some idea, and can respond to methods called on it. Importantly, the Model decides if incoming data is of a valid format before changing itself.

The Controller for that model listens for changes that need to be made from outside sources (usually user input).

The View is a collection of the visual elements returned to a user. This can be as simple as surfacing otherwise invisible low level data to a programmer from the console, or as complicated as the most intricate UIs and graphs you have seen.


This structure separates out responsibilities, limits repeated code, and creates a repeatable structure.
